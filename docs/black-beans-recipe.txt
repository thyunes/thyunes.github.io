Recipe for Traditional Brazilian Black Beans:

1 cup of dried black beans, sorted through (check for stones)
2 or 3 bay leaves (depending on size)
1.25 tsp of salt (may add more later if needed)

Put all the ingredients into the Instant Pot. Fill with enough water to cover beans plus 1.5 inch above. (In a 6-Quart Instant Pot, that's 4 cups of water.) Press "Manual" and set the timer to 27 minutes. Lid must be properly seated and the vent must be in sealing position. Pressure will take about 15 minutes to build up for the 27-minute timer to start counting down. Allow beans to manually release steam after the 27 minutes are up (don't move the vent). This takes about 15 extra minutes. So, overal, about 1h in the pot.

When beans are almost done, chop a head of garlic and sauté in 1 or 2 tablespoons of olive oil. When beans are done, remove the lid and add the sautéed garlic and oil. If there's still too much water left, press "Cancel" and then the "Sauté" button to evaporate some water. After enough water evaporates, taste the liquid and add more salt if needed.

Yield with 1 cup of dried beans: about 6 ladles of cooked beans.
