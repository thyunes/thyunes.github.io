CuSPLIB News and Update Log:
---------------------------

04/19/11:
--------

* We are proud to announce that three instances from CuSPLIB have been accepted into MIPLIB 2010!
  They are: csched007, csched008, csched010.
  For more information, consult the MIPLIB web site at http://miplib.zib.de.


11/15/09:
--------

* Updated time limits to 2 hours (rather than 1), as seems to be the standard
  practice in other problem libraries and/or benchmark sites.

* Added MIP results for Gurobi 2.0.0.


10/11/09:
--------

* Ran instance 8 of set "10 50 200 25 0 20 10 40 20 75 1 1" for 55 hours trying to
  find the optimal solution, but there is still a gap. See the min makespan
  results for details.


10/5/09:
-------

* Updated MIP results to CPLEX version 12.1.0.


10/1/09:
-------

* Increased machine capacity of instance 3 of set 10-50-200-25-0-20-10-40-20-75-1-1
  to make it feasible (capacity was increased from 25 to 29, which was the smallest
  feasible value).

* Updated data files, lp files, ZIMPL files, and result files to reflect the above
  change and the new runs with instance 3.

* Added file cumulative.cpp. This is a C++ program that uses ILOG Concert technology
  to solve CuSPs with either min makespan or min delay objectives. It reads data
  files in raw format.


9/29/09:
-------

* CuSPLIB released to the public.

* Wrote blog post about CuSPLIB at http://orbythebeach.wordpress.com.
